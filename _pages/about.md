#whoAmI
------
Hi, I'm Filippos and thank you very much for landing in my personal webpage!
I'm a scientist/engineer with a passion about creating data-driven biomaterials science and 
engineering platforms that aim to overcome scientific challenges with direct societal impact.

#whatDoIDo
------
Currently, I'm a PostDoc Associate at CBA under the supervision of Prof. Neil Gershenfeld. 
Check my <a href = "">projects</a>, find out about <a href = "">my ideas and learning adventures</a> and 
please reach out to me if you would like to collaborate on interesting projects.

In addition to that, I'm the lead engineer for materials data & development  for the [Materiom](https://materiom.org/mission-and-vision) 
platform; a non-profit initiative that aims to provide open source recipes and data on materials made from abundant sources of natural ingredients, like agricultural waste.

Lastly, I enjoy teaching classes at MIT with my most recent activity being both the lead TA for the <a href = "http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/864.20/index.html">Nature of
Mathematical Modeling</a> class that Neil is teaching every 2 years and an active student as well.
