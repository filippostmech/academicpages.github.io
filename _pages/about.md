#whoAmI
------
Hi, I'm Filippos and thank you very much for landing in my personal webpage.
I'm a scientist/engineer with a passion about creating data-driven biomaterials science and 
engineering platforms that aim to overcome scientific challenges with direct societal impact.

Questions that boggle my mind are:

- Can we engineer cell material systems that can guide biological function purely by geometrical cues? 

- How can we automate the whole biofabrication paradigm?

- Can we extend the lifecycle of recyclable plastics through the design of material-robot systems? 

- How will the materials' lab of the future look like?
  
- How can we enable the masses to produce their own materials?

Surprisingly, all these disparate questions can be answered and tackled by anyone who can freely 
move between design, fabrication and computing.

Currently, I'm a PostDoc Associate at CBA under the supervision of Prof. Neil Gershenfeld. 
Check my <a href = "">projects</a>, find out about <a href = "">my ideas and learning adventures</a> and 
please reach out to me if you would like to collaborate on interesting projects.

In addition to that, I'm the lead engineer for materials data & development  for the [Materiom](https://materiom.org/mission-and-vision) 
platform; a non-profit initiative that aims to provide open source recipes and data on materials made from abundant sources of natural ingredients, like agricultural waste.

Lastly, I enjoy teaching classes at MIT with my most recent activity being both the lead TA for the <a href = "http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/864.20/index.html">Nature of
Mathematical Modeling</a> class that Neil is teaching every 2 years and an active student as well.
